# Face Recognition Attendance System

## Introduction

This is a program that uses face recognition technology to check the attendance of students in a classroom. It has the potential to be a valuable tool for schools and universities to automate the process of taking attendance, save time. The program reads the timetable from a file and has trained data for the students' faces. The program starts detecting faces when the session starts, and at the end of the day, it outputs a result file containing attendance records.
